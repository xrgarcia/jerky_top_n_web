Coin Book

The player’s visual binder of all Flavor Coins, Collection Achievements, and Hidden Achievements.
Designed to evoke the feel of a physical quarter-collection book — progress is tactile, gaps are visible, and completion feels rewarding.

⸻

Flavor Coin

A coin earned when a user ranks a unique flavor for the first time.
Appears on the Flavor Coins Page of the Coin Book.
Each coin represents both participation (XP) and flavor history.

⸻

Static Collection Coin

An achievement for completing a fixed, finite set of flavors (e.g., Classic Beef).
These never change and can only be earned once.

⸻

Dynamic Collection Coin

An achievement tied to a living flavor group that updates automatically as new flavors are released or retired (e.g., All Beef or All Poultry).
Progress is measured by percentage of flavors ranked, determining the user’s tier (Bronze → Diamond).

⸻

Hidden Collection Coin

A secret or themed achievement that is hidden until the player unlocks it by meeting hidden criteria.
Examples: BBQ Lovers, Sweet Tooth, Heat Seeker.

⸻

Dynamic Master Collection

The umbrella term for the highest-level Dynamic Collections such as Beef Master, Exotic Master, Pork Master, and Poultry Master.
Each represents an evolving mastery challenge that tracks every flavor within its protein category.
Completion tiers follow the 5-tier system (Bronze 40%, Silver 60%, Gold 75%, Platinum 90%, Diamond 100%).

⸻

Tiered Achievement

Any achievement that progresses through visible ranks (Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum → Diamond).
Each tier unlocks automatically when the user passes the defined completion percentage.

⸻

Exploration (Internal Term)

Internal behavior type tracking breadth — how many new things a user tries.
Powers XP and achievement triggers but is never shown to players directly.

⸻

Discovery (Internal Term)

Internal behavior type tracking depth — how much a user refines or defines their preferences (e.g., re-ranking favorites, curating their Top 10).
Also invisible to players but used for balancing XP and achievement logic.
