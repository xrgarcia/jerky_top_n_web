Coin Book

The player's visual binder of all coins: Engagement Coins, Flavor Coins, Static Collection Coins, Dynamic Collection Coins, and Hidden Collection Coins.
Designed to evoke the feel of a physical quarter-collection book — progress is tactile, gaps are visible, and completion feels rewarding.

⸻

Engagement Coin

A coin earned through user site engagement activities that demonstrate both exploration (breadth of trying new things) and discovery (depth of refining preferences).
Includes activities like searches, logins, ranking streaks, and ranking milestones.
While the underlying mechanics track exploration and discovery, these are presented to users as unified "Engagement Coins."

⸻

Flavor Coin

A coin earned when a user ranks a unique flavor for the first time.
Appears on the Flavor Coins Page of the Coin Book.
Each coin represents both participation (XP) and flavor history.

⸻

Static Collection Coin

A coin earned for completing a fixed, finite set of flavors (e.g., Classic Beef, Original Master).
These never change and can only be earned once.

⸻

Dynamic Collection Coin

A coin tied to a living flavor group that updates automatically as new flavors are released or retired (e.g., All Beef or All Poultry).
Progress is measured by percentage of flavors ranked, determining the user's tier (Bronze → Diamond).

⸻

Hidden Collection Coin

A secret or themed coin that is hidden until the player unlocks it by meeting hidden criteria.
Examples: BBQ Lovers, Sweet Tooth, Heat Seeker.

⸻

Dynamic Master Collection

The umbrella term for the highest-level Dynamic Collections such as Beef Master, Exotic Master, Pork Master, and Poultry Master.
Each represents an evolving mastery challenge that tracks every flavor within its protein category.
Completion tiers follow the 5-tier system (Bronze 40%, Silver 60%, Gold 75%, Platinum 90%, Diamond 100%).

⸻

Tiered Achievement

Any achievement that progresses through visible ranks (Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum → Diamond).
Each tier unlocks automatically when the user passes the defined completion percentage.

⸻

Exploration (Internal Term)

Internal behavior type tracking breadth — how many new things a user tries.
Powers XP and achievement triggers but is never shown to players directly.
Part of the underlying mechanics for Engagement Coins.

⸻

Discovery (Internal Term)

Internal behavior type tracking depth — how much a user refines or defines their preferences (e.g., re-ranking favorites, curating their Top 10).
Also invisible to players but used for balancing XP and achievement logic.
Part of the underlying mechanics for Engagement Coins.
